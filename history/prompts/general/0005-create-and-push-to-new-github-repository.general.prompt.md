  I have created a new GitHub repository named "ROBOTICS-BOOK" under your account ("Huzaifa-Chhipa").
  I then removed the old remote origin from your local repository, added the new "ROBOTICS-BOOK" repository as the origin, and pushed all local files to it.
  The files are now available at: https://github.com/Huzaifa-Chhipa/ROBOTICS-BOOK
