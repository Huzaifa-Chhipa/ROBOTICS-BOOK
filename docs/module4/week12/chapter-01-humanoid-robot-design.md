# Humanoid Robot Design

This chapter explores mechanical and electrical aspects inherent in humanoid robot design. Humanoid robots, designed to mimic the human form, present unique engineering challenges due to their complex kinematics, dynamics, and interaction capabilities. We will delve into the mechanical structures of humanoid robots, discussing the design of their limbs, torso, and head to achieve desired degrees of freedom and workspace. Actuation systems, including high-torque density motors, compliant actuators, and hydraulic systems, will be examined in the context of achieving human-like strength, speed, and dexterity. Furthermore, the integration of extensive sensing systems, such as proprioceptive sensors (encoders, IMUs) for internal state estimation and exteroceptive sensors (cameras, force sensors) for environmental perception, will be covered. Understanding these design principles is crucial for building robust, agile, and expressive humanoid robots capable of operating in human-centric environments.
