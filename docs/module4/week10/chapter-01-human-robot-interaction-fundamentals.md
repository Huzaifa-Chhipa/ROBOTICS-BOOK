# Human-Robot Interaction Fundamentals

This chapter explores designing intuitive robot interfaces, delving into the fundamental principles of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). As robots become more prevalent in our daily lives, understanding how humans and robots can effectively and safely collaborate is paramount. We will discuss various communication modalities between humans and robots, including verbal commands, gestures, touch, and visual feedback. Key considerations for ensuring human safety in shared workspaces, such as collision avoidance and physical interaction control, will be examined. Furthermore, the chapter will cover human factors in HRI, focusing on concepts like trust, acceptance, legibility of robot intent, and how to design robots that are both efficient and user-friendly. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for developing robots that can seamlessly integrate into human environments and tasks.
