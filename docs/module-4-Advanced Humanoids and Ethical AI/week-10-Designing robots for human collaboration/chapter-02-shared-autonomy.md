# Shared Autonomy

This chapter explores collaborative control between humans and robots, focusing on the paradigm of shared autonomy. In shared autonomy, control authority is dynamically distributed between a human operator and an intelligent robotic system, allowing each to leverage their respective strengths. We will discuss different levels of shared autonomy, ranging from human teleoperation with robot assistance to highly autonomous robots with human supervision and intervention capabilities. Various control architectures and frameworks for implementing shared autonomy will be presented, including approaches based on impedance control, haptic feedback, and intention prediction. The benefits of shared autonomy, such as reduced human cognitive load, improved performance in complex tasks, and enhanced safety, will be highlighted. Understanding shared autonomy is key to developing more capable and adaptable robotic systems that can fluidly collaborate with humans in diverse applications.
